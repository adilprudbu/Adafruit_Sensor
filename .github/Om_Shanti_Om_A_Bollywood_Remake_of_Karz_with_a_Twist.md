Om Shanti Om is not only a tribute to the Bollywood cinema of the 1970s, but also a commentary on the changing trends and values of the film industry. The film contrasts the innocence and passion of Om Prakash Makhija with the arrogance and greed of Om Kapoor. The film also shows how fame and fortune can corrupt a person's soul and make them forget their true identity. The film explores the themes of love, destiny, karma, and reincarnation in a humorous and dramatic way.
 
The film also has a twist in the climax, where it is revealed that Sandhya is actually Shanti's daughter, who survived the fire as a baby. She was adopted by Rajesh Kapoor (Javed Sheikh), Om Kapoor's father and a famous producer. Om Kapoor realizes that he is not the reincarnation of Om Prakash Makhija, but his son, who was born after his death. He also learns that Mukesh Mehra is still alive and has changed his name to Mike (Arjun Rampal). He confronts Mike and exposes his crimes to the public. He also reunites with Sandhya and confesses his love for her.
 
The film ends with a happy note, where Om Kapoor and Sandhya get married and perform on stage with the ghosts of Om Prakash Makhija and Shanti Priya. The film also has a post-credits scene, where Farah Khan, the director of the film, makes a cameo appearance and thanks the audience for watching the film.
